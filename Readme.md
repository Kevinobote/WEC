# Optimizing Wave Energy Output

## Objective

To develop a predictive model that estimates the total power output of large-scale wave energy farms using machine learning techniques, and to analyze the impact of various features on power output.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises wave energy converters (WECs) configurations and their power outputs under different scenarios. It includes:

- **WEC Perth 49**
- **WEC Perth 100**
- **WEC Sydney 49**
- **WEC Sydney 100**

### Data Description

- **Features**: Coordinates (x, y), Hydrodynamic factors (qw), and Total Power.
- **Target Variable**: Total Power output of the wave farm.
- **Variables**: Includes x and y coordinates for WECs, hydrodynamic factors, and power output.

## Steps to Achieve the Objective

### 1. **Data Preparation**

1. **Data Loading**: Load each dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame) for analysis.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Identify missing values in the dataset.
   - Decide on a strategy for imputation. Use the mean for continuous numerical variables and the mode for categorical variables.
   - Replace missing values with the chosen imputation method.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Compute and review key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range for the target variable (Total Power).
   - Analyze the distribution and central tendency of the data.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Plot histograms and density plots to visualize the distribution of the Total Power and relevant features.
   - Use scatter plots to examine relationships between Total Power and other features like coordinates and hydrodynamic factors.

### 3. **Feature Analysis**

1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and Total Power.
   - Focus on highly correlated features to Total Power (e.g., qw).

2. **Significance of Coordinates**:
   - Understand the impact of x and y coordinates on power output.
   - Consider spatial relationships and interactions between WECs.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**

1. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80% training and 20% testing).

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).

3. **Training**:
   - Train the selected model(s) using the training dataset.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
   - Compare performance across different datasets to assess model accuracy and generalizability.

### 5. **Comparative Analysis**

1. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Compare model performance between datasets (e.g., WEC Sydney vs. WEC Perth) to identify patterns or differences.

2. **Classification for Performance Levels**:
   - Use classification models to categorize performance levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on predictive accuracy.

### 6. **Optimization Insights**

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyze the importance of different features in predicting Total Power.
   - Use insights to suggest optimizations in WEC configurations.

2. **Model Refinement**:
   - Refine the model based on performance metrics and feature importance.
   - Explore ensemble methods or other advanced techniques for improved predictions.
